mental health issues, but yet still manages to overcome the trails and tribulations
caused from her race, gender and social class.</p>

making it accessible for the disbaled. Also I had made 'Synopsis' and 'Trailer'
h3 elements as they are sub-titles for each section. I put this paragraph
element in the 'mainpara' class as I wanted it, along with other "p" elements on
the next page, to have a particular box model layout.-->
