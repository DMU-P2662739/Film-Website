<!-- I used an "img" element in order to display an image of one of my cast
memebers here, with the "src" allowing me to state the relative URL for the
browser to find the desired image. -->
<h4>Issa</h4>
<!-- I made both "Issa" and "Kim" h4 elemnts as they are both names of the
cast. -->
<p class="mainpara">Issa, also the lead actor in popular series
"Insecure" is playing herself as the lead role in this film. Her funny comedic
nature comes across as a strong coping mechanism for her as accurately portrays
the and enducrance you need to cope and get over the trials and tribulation that
come with the inequalities of her skintone, gender and social background.
</p>
<!--I put this and the other paragraph on this page inthe "mainpara" as I wanted
them to have the same characteristics as the one on the front page. -->

<h4>Kim</h4>
<p class="mainpara">Kim, the widely known celebrity perosnality and
husband as Kanye West, plays herself as one of the antagonist roles in the film.
Due to the mass controversy and discorse she'd created surrounding cultural
appropriation due to her culturally offensive choice to wear braids to the MTV
Awards, We thought Kim would be accurate in representing the girls who culturally
offend darkskinned black women, using her to show the world what our B.A.M.E
women have to deal with.
